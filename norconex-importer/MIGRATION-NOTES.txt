To migrate your code from 1.x to 2.0.0, read the following:

* New package locations for handlers:

    *.importer.filter.*      --> *.importer.handler.filter.*
    *.importer.tagger.*      --> *.importer.handler.tagger.*
    *.importer.transformer.* --> *.importer.handler.transformer.*

* Importing a document previously returned a boolean value, whether the
  document could be imported properly or not.   It now returns a 
  IImporterResponse, which hold one or more imported document (in case of 
  nested documents), along with an ImporterStatus.

* Signature methods on importDocument methods of the Importer class have 
  changed.  It now accepts an optional character encoding value and it no 
  longer accepts an output stream/file.
  
* References to com.norconex.importer.ContentType were replaced with 
  com.norconex.commons.lang.file.ContentType.

* For consistency, several references to metadata field names were 
  renamed to use the term "field" (instead of property or else).
