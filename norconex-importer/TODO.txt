
MUST for 2.0.0 release:
==============

- MERGE TAGGERS AND TRANSFORMERS?  Since with version 2.0.0 nothing gets 
  streamed if only dealing with metadata, there not much value in separating
  the two of then now.   Where a field is required as input, not specifying
  any would mean to apply on the content, unless the javadoc clearly says
  it applies only to fields.  Create abstract classes for those dealing
  with metadata only, and those with content + metadata plus reading only 
  (default will be all these + output).
    - When text documents are processed in chunks because too big, how
      to mix that with field transformation.  We do not want to re-operate
      on the same fields when processing a new content section of the same
      doc.
  
- Be consistant in the way metadata fields are named.  Use the term 
  metadata "field" all across.
  

- Return ImporterOutput instead, which will hold: isRejected, rejectedCause, 
  ImportDocument.  This involves building a generic way to report issues
  as opposed to rely on log4j alone (or instead of?)

- Have the CsvSplitter offer to provide which column has the 
  reference field (for each child docs), and which fields should make up 
  content (if any).
  
- Find a way to handle returning an input stream in the ImportDocument. 
  Shall we write to file and provide a regular input stream instead?
  How to make sure the inputStream gets closed if the caller is not 
  interested in the content?
  Maybe have the input stream created on demand?  Maybe the CachedInputStream
  is already safe to use (will delete cache file on finalize)?


?? have a RejectionCause returned instead of boolean?

?? Move transformer, tagger, filter, under handler package?

++ DONE: Make it possible to bypass parsing for some files (when people want to 
   index raw documents as-is.

++ DONE: Write tmp files in specified temp directory (defaulting to system tmp)

++ DONE: Make an all memory-only options (as opposed to always rely on files
   after each modification).   Best senario would be to always use memory,
   except when too big, then swap.

++ DONE: Add document splitting in multiple docs, with option to keep the parent
   document or not and offer options what the document reference should be
   (default: parentref!childref).


Any release:
==============

- Have "conditional" handler decorators that would act wrapper around other
  handlers, but those will only be invoked when the condition matches.
  That would better than having tons of filter options on every handlers 
  defined.  This is different than usual filters since documents are not
  rejected if they do not meet a condition, they move on to the next handler.
  

- Add CharacterCaseTransformer (upper, lower, sentence, word)

- Add a TextStatisticsTagger (or TextMetricsTagger) that add fields for things
  such as: num of characters, num of words, average word length, average,
  sentence length, average paragraph length, etc.


- Offer ways to force Character Encoding.

- Make it easier to change output format (but how to make it work with
  committer still?).
