==============

- Add better defined Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) support, 
  leveraging Tika GDAL support.
- Create a dynamic title generator and/or a handler that can read the X first
  nuber of characters.
- Add a counter as method argument to AbstractStringTagger so we know which 
  "chunk" of text we are processing (1st, 2nd, etc).
