
MUST for 2.0.0 release:
==============


- Add language detection

- Add document splitting in multiple docs, with option to keep the parent
  document or not and offer options what the document reference should be
  (default: parentref!childref).

- Return ImporterOutput instead, which will hold: isRejected, rejectedCause, ImportDocument

- Make it possible to bypass parsing for some files (when people want to index
  raw documents as-is.

- Have a CSV and TSV splitter implementations? Asking which column has the 
  reference field, and which fields should make up content (if any).

?? have a RejectionCause returned instead of boolean?

?? Move transformer, tagger, filter, under handler package?

++ DONE: Write tmp files in specified temp directory (defaulting to system tmp)

++ DONE: Make an all memory-only options (as opposed to always rely on files
   after each modification).   Best senario would be to always use memory,
   except when too big, then swap.

Any release:
==============

- Add CharacterCaseTransformer (upper, lower, sentence, word)

- Offer ways to force Character Encoding.

- Make it easier to change output format (but how to make it work with
  committer still?).
